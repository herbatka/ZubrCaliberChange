This mod aims to add a plethera of different options for gun customization.
More upgrades, caliber changes, overall overhaul of the weapon upgrade systems.

For now I added a caliber change option to the Zubr SMG, but I've run into problems with getting the techs to actually upgrade it.

This mod requires you to have the PreOrder DLC, It should be compatible with any other mods without problems as it doesn't overwrite the base game .cfg files, it only adds new lines to them.
