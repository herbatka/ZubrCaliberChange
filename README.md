# Compatibilty notes
This mod creates a new custom DLC, It should be compatible with any other mods without problems as it doesn't overwrite the base game .cfg files.

# Future plans
This mod aims to add a plethera of different options for gun customization. More upgrades, caliber changes, overall overhaul of the weapon upgrade systems.
For now I added a caliber change option to the Zubr SMG.
