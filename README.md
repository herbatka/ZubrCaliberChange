This mod aims to add a plethera of different options for gun customization. More upgrades, caliber changes, overall overhaul of the weapon upgrade systems.

For now I added a caliber change option to the Zubr SMG, but I've run into problems with getting the techs to actually upgrade it.

This mod creates a new custom DLC, It should be compatible with any other mods without problems as it doesn't overwrite the base game .cfg files.
